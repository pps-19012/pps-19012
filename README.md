### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pushpendra, an aspiring software developer currently pursuing my undergraduate studies at IIT Gandhinagar. Here is a glimpse into my journey and interests in the world of software development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as an SDE intern in Data Analytics and Infrastructure Services team at [Trading Technologies International, Inc.](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about data migration, services integration and data processing using Apache Spark, AWS and Cassandra.
- ðŸ’» In order to understand emerging technologies, I have tried my hand at learning about blockchain development and game development through personal projects. I have also contributed to open-source projects related to machine learning and web development.
- ðŸ’¡ Apart from software development, I like to solve coding challenges and problems at [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/pushpendra3000/) and Codeforces.
- ðŸ“« You can email me at `pushpendra.pratap@iitgn.ac.in` / `pushpendrasingh.19012@gmail.com` or text at `+91 9601160145` to collaborate on cool and interesting projects.
